# Tailwind CSS Hover Class Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem where Tailwind CSS hover classes fail to apply correctly.  Other Tailwind classes on the same element and similar elements elsewhere in the project function as expected.  The `hover:bg-blue-700` class does not change the background color upon hovering.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Hover over the div element.  You'll observe that the background color does not change to blue.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the following:

1. **Correct Tailwind CSS configuration:** Ensure Tailwind is properly configured in your project. Check your `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs` file for any errors and that your CSS file is correctly imported.
2. **CSS Specificity:**  Check for conflicting CSS rules or styles that might be overriding Tailwind's hover class.  Ensure that your stylesheet doesn't have more specific selectors that might be overriding the `hover` state.
3. **Parent Container Styles:** Check the parent element of the div.  It could contain `pointer-events: none;` which disables hover events on its children.
4. **JavaScript Interference:**  Make sure no JavaScript code is interfering with the application of the Tailwind classes or with the DOM manipulation that would prevent the hover effect from triggering.
5. **Caching:** Clear the browser cache and try again to rule out cached CSS issues.

The solution code provided demonstrates the expected functioning of Tailwind hover classes after correcting potential issues.
