The following Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly:

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700">
  Hover me
</div>
```

The background color does not change on hover.  This is happening despite other Tailwind classes working correctly on the same element and similar elements elsewhere in the project.
