The issue was resolved by identifying a conflicting CSS rule in an external stylesheet. The external stylesheet had a more specific rule that inadvertently overruled the Tailwind hover class.

Here's the corrected HTML:

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700">
  Hover me
</div>
```

This simple HTML, once the conflicting CSS was removed, correctly applies the hover class.
